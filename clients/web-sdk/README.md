# @moor/web-sdk

Shared TypeScript SDK for mooR web-facing clients.

This package is intended to hold protocol-level logic shared by Meadow and other clients, while
UI/application-specific code remains in each client.

It provides TypesScript bindings to call the moor-web-host API.

## Scope

- Auth header helpers for mooR web-host
- HTTP endpoint wrappers
- WebSocket attach/reattach protocol helpers
- FlatBuffer decoding/encoding helpers

## Narrative decoding

`parseNarrativeValue` returns the shared `ParsedNarrativePayload` discriminated union for
notifications, presentations, tracebacks, unpresent events, and data events. WebSocket and history
parsing use this same decoder. Captured invocation output adapts the decoded payload to its
`eventType` envelope. Decoder callbacks receive the generated FlatBuffer `Var` type; decoded
notification content must be a string or an array of strings.

Notifications accept `text/plain`, `text/djot`, `text/html`, and `text/x-uri`, including their
underscore wire spellings. An omitted content type defaults to plain text. Explicit unsupported or
empty types return `null`, as do missing required payload fields and invalid notification content.
Presentations accept the same types except `text/x-uri`. `text/traceback` is an application
rendering type for traceback events, not a notification content type.

Optional metadata is checked before it enters typed fields. Opaque MOO values remain `unknown` until
a consumer narrows them. Malformed binary buffers can throw during FlatBuffer access or Var
decoding; callers must catch those failures at the transport boundary. Meadow discards invalid
live/history payloads and retains history pagination metadata independently of accepted events.

## 2.0 Development

This package is a private npm workspace during the 2.0 development cycle. Install dependencies and
run its build from the mooR repository root so npm resolves `@moor/schema` from the same checkout.

External package distribution will be reconsidered when the 2.0 API is ready for independent
clients. The monorepo does not publish development snapshots to an npm registry.

on top of it, but must also comply with the LGPL-3.0-or-later license if you modify the source code
to the library itself.
