# Structured Data Matching and Pathfinding

These mooR extensions provide kernel-side algorithms for structured MOO values. They are intended
for cases where MOO code would otherwise spend a large amount of time walking nested lists, maps, or
list-backed data structures in tight loops. Two kinds of algorithms are provided: pattern matching
for structured data, and pathfinding for tile-based maps.

## Pattern matching for structured data

Suppose your world stores exits as records like `{'exit, #10, 'north, #20}`. To find every exit
leaving room #10, you might write something like this:

```moo
found = {};
for rec in (exit_records)
  if (rec[2] == #10)
    found = {@found, rec};
  endif
endfor
```

That works for a handful of records. But when the list grows long, or the record shape gets more
complicated, the per-record check slows down and the code to pick apart each record gets harder to
read.

The `term_unify()`, `term_match()`, `term_query()`, and `term_substitute()` builtins make that kind
of structured-data work faster and simpler. Instead of pulling each record apart by hand, you write
a pattern that describes what you are looking for. Use `term_unify()` to match one value,
`term_match()` to match a list of values, or `term_query()` when you also need rules:

```moo
term_query({'exit, #10, {'var, 'Dir}, {'var, 'To}}, exit_records)
=> {['Dir -> 'north, 'To -> #20], ...}
```

For larger cases, `term_query()` can also follow simple positive rules over the facts you provide,
so recursive queries like "find every room reachable from here" become a single call.

You can think of them as pattern matching for structured data, similar to how
[`match()`](regex.md#match) searches for a regex pattern in a string — but they work on lists and
maps instead of on text, and the "captures" are named placeholders rather than numbered groups.

A **pattern** is a MOO value with "holes" in it. Each hole is a placeholder, written as a two-item
list:

```moo
{'var, 'Name}
```

The symbol `'var` marks this list as a placeholder — it tells the server "this is not a normal list,
treat it as a variable". The second item, `'Name`, is the variable's name. Using a symbol like
`'var` as a tag means placeholders are always two-element lists whose first element is `'var`, so
they stand out from ordinary data and can never be confused with a real record that just happens to
contain a symbol called `'var`.

A **term** is just the MOO value you want to check against the pattern. When the structure matches,
every hole gets filled in and you receive a map of the filled-in values.

For example, this pattern:

```moo
{'edge, {'var, 'From}, {'var, 'To}}
```

matches this value:

```moo
{'edge, #10, #11}
```

and `term_unify()` returns this binding map:

```moo
['From -> #10, 'To -> #11]
```

The server does not know what your records mean. A list like `{'edge, #10, #11}` might mean "there
is an edge from `#10` to `#11`", and a map like `["action" -> "property_write", "object" -> #123]`
might mean "write a property on `#123`" — but the server only sees lists, maps, symbols, strings,
objects, and numbers. It matches structure, not meaning.

Common uses for these functions include:

- Finding everywhere reachable through a graph of exits or connections.
- Searching a list of records for ones that match a particular shape.
- Checking whether a rule or policy matches the current situation.
- Matching event or command descriptions.
- Filling in an action structure from values that were matched.

For example, a builder tool might store exits as `{'exit, from, direction, to}` records, then ask
for all exits whose `from` value is the current room. Or a policy helper might match a validated
request and then fill in an action structure from the values that were matched.

Only lists and map values are searched recursively. Map keys are treated as fixed keys, not
placeholders.

These builtins do not inspect world state, object ownership, task permissions, or call MOO verbs.

## `term_unify`

```moo
MAP | BOOL term_unify(ANY pattern, ANY value [, MAP bindings [, MAP options]])
```

Compares a pattern with exactly one value. On success, returns the extended bindings map. On
mismatch, returns false.

Use `term_unify()` when you have a single value to check — for example, a record you pulled out of a
list with `listassoc()`, or a verb argument you want to match against a command template.

```moo
term_unify({'edge, {'var, 'From}, {'var, 'To}}, {'edge, #10, #11})
=> ['From -> #10, 'To -> #11]
```

Repeated variables must match the same value:

```moo
term_unify({'edge, {'var, 'From}, {'var, 'From}}, {'edge, #10, #11})
=> 0
```

Existing bindings are respected:

```moo
term_unify({'edge, {'var, 'From}, {'var, 'To}},
           {'edge, #10, #11},
           ['From -> #10])
=> ['From -> #10, 'To -> #11]
```

Lists are compared item by item and must have equal length. Maps must have the same keys; values
under those keys are compared recursively. Non-placeholder values compare with normal MOO equality.

## `term_match`

```moo
LIST term_match(ANY pattern, LIST values [, MAP bindings [, MAP options]])
```

Applies one pattern to each value in a list and returns the binding maps for successful matches.
This is the batch form of `term_unify()` for callers that have explicit candidate values and do not
need `term_query()` rules.

```moo
term_match({'edge, #10, {'var, 'To}},
           {
             {'edge, #10, #11},
             {'edge, #10, #12},
             {'edge, #20, #21}
           })
=> {['To -> #11], ['To -> #12]}
```

Initial bindings are applied to each candidate independently. By default duplicate binding maps are
removed.

## `term_query`

```moo
LIST term_query(ANY query, LIST facts [, LIST rules [, MAP bindings [, MAP options]]])
```

Searches caller-supplied facts and optional rules for every way to satisfy one query. This is useful
when MOO code would otherwise run nested loops or recursive walks over list-backed records, such as:

- finding every room reachable through an exit graph,
- expanding a small policy rule set,
- matching event records against rules with shared variables,
- deriving implied records from a supplied list of explicit records.

The server still does not know what your terms mean. It only matches list and map structure, fills
variables, and follows the rules you supplied in the function arguments.

For search over explicit facts, pass one or more facts and omit `rules`:

```moo
term_query({'edge, {'var, 'From}, {'var, 'To}},
           {{'edge, #10, #11}})
=> {['From -> #10, 'To -> #11]}
```

Ordinary mismatch returns an empty list:

```moo
term_query({'edge, {'var, 'From}, {'var, 'From}},
           {{'edge, #10, #11}})
=> {}
```

Repeated variables must match the same value. Initial bindings are respected:

```moo
term_query({'edge, {'var, 'From}, {'var, 'To}},
           {{'edge, #10, #11}},
           {},
           ['From -> #10])
=> {['From -> #10, 'To -> #11]}
```

Lists are compared item by item and must have equal length. Maps must have the same keys; values
under those keys are compared recursively. Non-placeholder values compare with normal MOO equality.

`facts` is a list of terms. Facts may be ground:

```moo
{'edge, #1, #2}
```

or partially ground:

```moo
{'edge, {'var, 'From}, #2}
```

Variables inside facts behave like wildcards for that fact. They are fresh for each attempted match
— each time the query engine tries a fact against a goal, that fact's variables get new internal
names — so they are never returned as output variables and cannot interfere with other matches.

`rules` is a list of `{head, body}` pairs. The head is one term. The body is a list of positive
terms. Each time a rule is tried, its variables are also given fresh internal names, so the same
rule can apply to different values in different search branches without conflict.

```moo
{
  {'reachable, {'var, 'A}, {'var, 'B}},
  {
    {'edge, {'var, 'A}, {'var, 'B}}
  }
}
```

This rule says that `A` reaches `B` when there is an `edge` from `A` to `B`.

Recursive rules are allowed, subject to the search limits and the running task's normal tick budget:

```moo
rules = {
  {
    {'reachable, {'var, 'A}, {'var, 'B}},
    {
      {'edge, {'var, 'A}, {'var, 'B}}
    }
  },
  {
    {'reachable, {'var, 'A}, {'var, 'B}},
    {
      {'edge, {'var, 'A}, {'var, 'C}},
      {'reachable, {'var, 'C}, {'var, 'B}}
    }
  }
};

term_query({'reachable, #1, {'var, 'Where}},
           {
             {'edge, #1, #2},
             {'edge, #2, #3},
             {'edge, #3, #4}
           },
           rules)
=> {['Where -> #2], ['Where -> #3], ['Where -> #4]}
```

Results are a list of binding maps keyed by the variable symbols from the query and any initial
bindings. The order is deterministic: facts and rules are tried in the order supplied.

Rules are restricted in v1:

- Positive Horn-style clauses only.
- No negation.
- No aggregation.
- No cuts.
- No arithmetic or comparison predicates.
- No implicit fact providers.
- No MOO callbacks.
- No world access or permission checks.

Every variable in a rule head must also appear in that rule's positive body. Use `facts` for base
cases rather than bodyless rules.

Malformed variable markers, such as `{'var}`, `{'var, 'A, 'B}`, or `{'var, "A"}`, and malformed
rules raise `E_INVARG`.

MOO symbols compare case-insensitively, so `'From` and `'from` are the same variable identifier.
Initial capitals are only a naming convention.

## `term_substitute`

```moo
ANY term_substitute(ANY template, MAP bindings [, MAP options])
```

Returns a copy of a structured value with every `{'var, name}` placeholder replaced by the
corresponding binding.

If `term_unify()` and `term_query()` are "match patterns and pull values out", then
`term_substitute()` is the companion operation: "push values into a template". You might match a
request with `term_unify()` or `term_query()`, then build a response with `term_substitute()`.

```moo
term_substitute({"property_write", {'var, 'Target}, "description"},
                ['Target -> #123])
=> {"property_write", #123, "description"}
```

By default, unbound variables raise `E_INVARG`. To leave unbound markers in place, pass
`['unbound -> 'leave]`:

```moo
term_substitute({"property_write", {'var, 'Missing}},
                [],
                ['unbound -> 'leave])
=> {"property_write", {'var, 'Missing}}
```

## Term inspection helpers

```moo
LIST term_variables(ANY term [, MAP options])
```

Returns the unique variable names in a term, in traversal order. Variable names are returned as
symbols.

```moo
term_variables({'edge, {'var, 'From}, {'var, 'To}, {'var, 'From}})
=> {'From, 'To}
```

```moo
BOOL term_ground(ANY term [, MAP options])
```

Returns true if the term contains no `{'var, symbol}` markers.

```moo
term_ground({'edge, #10, #11})
=> 1

term_ground({'edge, #10, {'var, 'To}})
=> 0
```

```moo
ANY term_normalize(ANY term [, MAP bindings [, MAP options]])
```

Resolves any supplied bindings, then canonicalizes remaining variables by first encounter:
`{'var, 'V1}`, `{'var, 'V2}`, and so on. This is useful when comparing two terms while ignoring the
specific variable names chosen by the caller.

```moo
term_normalize({'edge, {'var, 'Y}, {'var, 'X}, {'var, 'Y}},
               ['X -> #10])
=> {'edge, {'var, 'V1}, #10, {'var, 'V1}}
```

## Options

`term_unify()`, `term_substitute()`, `term_variables()`, `term_ground()`, and `term_normalize()`
accept:

```moo
[
  'max_depth -> 64,
  'max_bindings -> 256
]
```

`term_substitute()` also accepts:

```moo
['unbound -> 'raise]  "default"
['unbound -> 'leave]
```

`term_match()` accepts:

```moo
[
  'max_depth -> 64,
  'max_bindings -> 256,
  'max_solutions -> 256,
  'max_steps -> 10000,
  'dedupe -> true
]
```

`term_query()` accepts:

```moo
[
  'max_depth -> 32,
  'max_bindings -> 256,
  'max_solutions -> 256,
  'max_steps -> 10000,
  'dedupe -> true
]
```

`max_depth` limits recursive traversal and, for `term_query()`, recursive rule expansion.
`max_bindings` limits the number of variables that may be present in the binding set.
`max_solutions` stops the query search after that many answers. `max_steps` limits the total amount
of search work before the builtin raises `E_MAXREC`. `term_query()` also consumes the running task's
normal tick budget as it searches, so expensive queries can raise `E_MAXREC` even before `max_steps`
is reached. `dedupe` removes duplicate result maps and suppresses repeated active recursive states.

## Pathfinding with `astar`

The `astar()` function is separate from the `term_*` functions above. It can be used to find the
shortest walkable path between two points on a flat list that represents a two-dimensional tile grid
— like a game map. You might use it to route an NPC around walls in a dungeon, or find a walkable
route across an overworld. Writing a pathfinder in MOO is possible but slow for large maps;
`astar()` does the search in native code.

```moo
LIST astar(INT width, INT height,
           INT start_x, INT start_y,
           INT goal_x, INT goal_y,
           LIST tile_map, LIST solid_tiles
           [, MAP options])
```

Returns a list of `{x, y}` waypoints from the start to the goal, excluding the start position. If no
path exists, it returns `{}`. With `['return -> 'cost]`, it returns the path cost instead, or `-1`
when no path exists. With `['return -> 'detail]`, it returns a map with `'path`, `'cost`,
`'visited`, and `'found` entries.

### The tile map

The map is a flat list of tile IDs, laid out left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Think of it as reading
the grid row by row, like lines of text:

```moo
tile_map = {
  1, 1, 2,
  1, 3, 1
}
```

For a width of 3, that represents this 3-by-2 grid:

```text
(0,0)=1  (1,0)=1  (2,0)=2
(0,1)=1  (1,1)=3  (2,1)=1
```

Coordinates are zero-based: `(0, 0)` is the top-left tile, `(width-1, height-1)` is the
bottom-right.

To look up the tile at position `(x, y)` in the list, use:

```moo
index = y * width + x + 1
```

The `+ 1` accounts for MOO lists being one-based.

### Walkable and solid tiles

Each tile has an integer ID. You tell `astar()` which IDs are impassable by passing them in
`solid_tiles`. Any tile whose ID is in that list is treated as a wall; everything else is walkable.
Extra entries in `tile_map` past `width * height` are ignored. Missing entries are treated as
walkable.

### Movement

Movement is 8-directional (including diagonals). Diagonal moves are only allowed when both adjacent
cardinal tiles are also walkable, so paths cannot cut through the corner of a wall:

```text
.  .  .
X  .  .          X = solid
.  .  .
```

Moving diagonally from `(0, 0)` to `(1, 1)` might look open — the destination is floor — but the
adjacent tile `(0, 1)` is solid, so the diagonal is blocked. You would have to step to `(1, 0)`
first, then down to `(1, 1)`.

Without that restriction, the path would cut through the corner of the wall tile.

The optional `options` map accepts:

```moo
[
  'directions -> 8,
  'corner_cutting -> false,
  'return -> 'path,
  'max_nodes -> 1000
]
```

`directions` may be `4` or `8`. Four-directional movement only uses north, south, east, and west.
Eight-directional movement is the default and includes diagonals. `corner_cutting` controls whether
diagonal movement may pass between two blocked cardinal neighbors. `return` may be `'path`, `'cost`,
or `'detail`. `max_nodes`, when present, limits the number of grid nodes the search may visit before
raising `E_MAXREC`.

### Example

A 3-by-3 open grid with start at `(0, 0)` and goal at `(2, 2)`:

```moo
astar(3, 3,
      0, 0,
      2, 2,
      {
        1, 1, 1,
        1, 1, 1,
        1, 1, 1
      },
      {9})
=> {{1, 1}, {2, 2}}
```

The path reaches the goal in two diagonal steps. Diagonal moves cost the same as cardinal moves, so
this is a shortest valid path.

### Notes

The exact path is deterministic for a given map, but callers should treat any shortest valid path as
acceptable. If the goal tile is solid, or no route reaches it, the function returns `{}`. Invalid
dimensions or out-of-bounds start/goal coordinates raise `E_INVARG`.

`astar()` consumes the running task's normal tick budget as it searches. Large or difficult path
requests can therefore raise `E_MAXREC` if the task runs out of ticks before the search finishes, or
if the optional `max_nodes` limit is reached.

## Grid helper functions

The grid helpers use the same flat `tile_map` and `solid_tiles` representation as `astar()`.
Coordinates are zero-based and `tile_map` is row-major. Missing map entries are treated as walkable,
and extra entries are ignored.

```moo
LIST grid_line(INT width, INT height,
               INT x0, INT y0,
               INT x1, INT y1)
```

Returns the inclusive Bresenham line between two in-bounds grid coordinates. Both endpoints are
included in the returned list.

```moo
grid_line(5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 2)
=> {{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {2, 1}, {3, 2}, {4, 2}}
```

```moo
BOOL grid_los(INT width, INT height,
              INT x0, INT y0,
              INT x1, INT y1,
              LIST tile_map, LIST solid_tiles)
```

Returns true if every tile on the inclusive line between the two points is walkable. A solid start
or end tile blocks line of sight.

```moo
LIST grid_reachable(INT width, INT height,
                    INT start_x, INT start_y,
                    LIST tile_map, LIST solid_tiles
                    [, MAP options])
```

Returns every coordinate reachable from the start tile, excluding the start tile itself. If the
start tile is solid, it returns `{}`.

```moo
LIST grid_flood(INT width, INT height,
                INT start_x, INT start_y,
                LIST tile_map, LIST solid_tiles
                [, MAP options])
```

Returns the flood-filled region reachable from the start tile, including the start tile. This is the
same search as `grid_reachable()`, but with the origin included for callers that want the full
component.

`grid_reachable()` and `grid_flood()` accept:

```moo
[
  'directions -> 8,
  'corner_cutting -> false,
  'max_nodes -> 1000
]
```

`directions`, `corner_cutting`, and `max_nodes` have the same meaning as the `astar()` options.
These searches consume the running task's normal tick budget and may raise `E_MAXREC` if the task
runs out of ticks or `max_nodes` is reached.
